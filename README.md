# Restaurant-Management-System
A SQL code for Restaurant Management System was implemented.

So here I have made this database for a restaurant which supports both online as well as offline ordering.

Limitation of this database is that I have taken one customer who can order only once and only 3 items at a time.
To overcome this either you can do is increase the number of items one can order or you can add multivalued attributes
to the order.

If there are multivalued attributes then there will be insert, delete and update anomalies.

So then you will have to normalize the tables and the anomalies will be removed.

Here the payment modes of restaurant are online and offline, where online consists of paytm and cash on delivery
and offline ordering consists of the bill paid directly to the cashier in the restaurant.
